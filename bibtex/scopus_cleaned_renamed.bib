	abstract  = {This study investigates the neural underpinnings of cognitive control deficits in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), focusing on trial-level variability of neural coding. Using fMRI, we apply a computational approach to single-trial neural decoding on a cued stop-signal task, probing proactive and reactive control within the dual control model. Reactive control involves suppressing an automatic response when interference is detected, and proactive control involves implementing preparatory strategies based on prior information. In contrast to typically developing children (TD), children with ADHD show disrupted neural coding during both proactive and reactive control, characterized by increased temporal variability and diminished spatial stability in neural responses in salience and frontal-parietal network regions. This variability correlates with fluctuating task performance and ADHD symptoms. Additionally, children with ADHD exhibit more heterogeneous neural response patterns across individuals compared to TD children. Our findings underscore the significance of modeling trial-wise neural variability in understanding cognitive control deficits in ADHD. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {Background: Decoding neural activity to reverse-engineer sensory inputs advances understanding of neural encoding and boosts brain-computer interface and visual prosthesis tech. A major challenge is high-quality RGB image reconstruction from natural scenes, which this study tackles using pigeon optic tectum neurons. New method: We built a neural response dataset via microelectrode arrays capturing tectal neurons' ON-OFF responses to RGB images. A modular decoding algorithm, integrating a convolutional encoding network, linear decoder, and image enhancement network, enabled inverse RGB image reconstruction from neural signals. Results: Experimental results confirmed high-quality RGB image reconstruction by the proposed algorithm. For all test set reconstructions, average metrics were: correlation coefficient (R) of 0.853, structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.618, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 19.94 dB, and feature similarity index (FSIMc) of 0.801. These results confirm accurate recapitulation of both color and contour details of the original images. Comparison with existing methods: In terms of key quantitative metrics, the proposed algorithm achieves a significant improvement over traditional linear reconstruction methods, with the correlation coefficient (R) increased by 12.65 %, the structural similarity index (SSIM) increased by 38.92 %, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) increased by 12.65 %, and the feature similarity index (FSIMc) increased by 9.28 %. Conclusions: This research provides a novel technical pathway for high-quality visual neural decoding, with robust experimental metrics validating its effectiveness. It also offers experimental evidence to support investigations into the information processing mechanisms of the avian visual pathway. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {In cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface research, accurately predicting imagined stimuli is crucial. This study investigates the effectiveness of Domain Adaptation (DA) in enhancing imagery prediction using primarily visual data from fMRI scans of 18 subjects. Initially, we train a baseline model on visual stimuli to predict imagined stimuli, utilizing data from 14 brain regions. We then develop several models to improve imagery prediction, comparing different DA methods. Our results demonstrate that DA significantly enhances imagery prediction in binary classification on our dataset, as well as in multiclass classification on a publicly available dataset. We then conduct a DA-enhanced searchlight analysis, followed by permutation-based statistical tests to identify brain regions where imagery decoding is consistently above chance across subjects. Our DA-enhanced searchlight predicts imagery contents in a highly distributed set of brain regions, including the visual cortex and the frontoparietal cortex, thereby outperforming standard cross-domain classification methods.

	abstract  = {Until recently, mental imagery has largely been regarded as an exclusively conscious phenomenon. However, recent empirical results suggest that mental imagery can also occur unconsciously. People who report having no experiences of mental imagery often perform similar to controls on behavioural tasks thought to require imagery. A surprising number of them also display significant levels of imagery-based priming, and recent neural decoding studies have shown that imagery-related information is being processed in their visual cortex. However, investigating unconscious imagery empirically is not straightforward. One challenge is to establish that imagery is genuinely unconscious as opposed to merely going unreported due to response biases. Another is to clarify how imagistic and indirect perceptual processing needs to be to qualify as imagery. In this paper, we take a closer look at the evidence for unconscious imagery, argue that it is not as compelling as it initially appears, and outline a strategy for advancing research on this question. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {aphantasia; Article; guided imagery; human; imagery; mental disease; mental performance; mental task; unconscious (psychology); unconscious imagery; visual cortex},

	abstract  = {Understanding human visual intent through brain signals remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Despite recent advances in brain decoding, existing approaches typically operate within isolated datasets and modalities, limiting their generalization capabilities. This paper introduces BrainVision, a novel framework that bridges visual recognition and emotional EEG datasets to enable comprehensive visual content generation through cross-domain learning. BrainVision addresses the critical challenge of leveraging complementary information across heterogeneous EEG sources by implementing a unified cross-domain alignment strategy. Our framework maps neural patterns from the THINGS-EEG visual recognition dataset and the DEAP emotional response dataset into a shared representation space, enabling three distinct visual output capabilities: (1) accurate content retrieval and classification, (2) detailed linguistic descriptions through adapter-enhanced large language models, and (3) high-fidelity image reconstruction via stable diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainVision significantly outperforms single-domain approaches, achieving a 15.3% increase in retrieval accuracy and a 12.7% improvement in structural similarity for reconstructed images compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization, maintaining 82% of its performance when applied to novel stimuli not seen during training. The multi-modal outputs provide complementary interpretations of neural activity, offering a more comprehensive understanding of visual intent. Our findings establish that integrating diverse neural datasets substantially enhances the capabilities of brain decoding systems, providing a promising direction for developing more intuitive and versatile brain-computer interfaces.

	abstract  = {Advances in brain decoding, particularly in visual image reconstruction, have sparked discussions about the societal implications and ethical considerations of neurotechnology. As reconstruction methods aim to recover visual experiences from brain activity and achieve prediction beyond training samples (zero-shot prediction), it is crucial to assess their capabilities and limitations to inform public expectations and regulations. Our case study of recent text-guided reconstruction methods, which leverage a large-scale dataset (Natural Scenes Dataset, NSD) and text-to-image diffusion models, reveals critical limitations in their generalizability, demonstrated by poor reconstructions on a different dataset. UMAP visualization of the text features from NSD images shows limited diversity with overlapping semantic and visual clusters between training and test sets. We identify that clustered training samples can lead to “output dimension collapse,” restricting predictable output feature dimensions. While diverse training data improves generalization over the entire feature space without requiring exponential scaling, text features alone prove insufficient for mapping to the visual space. Our findings suggest that the apparent realism in current text-guided reconstructions stems from a combination of classification into trained categories and inauthentic image generation (hallucination) through diffusion models, rather than genuine visual reconstruction. We argue that careful selection of datasets and target features, coupled with rigorous evaluation methods, is essential for achieving authentic visual image reconstruction. These insights underscore the importance of grounding interdisciplinary discussions in a thorough understanding of the technology's current capabilities and limitations to ensure responsible development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Photointerpretation; Brain activity; Brain decoding; Images reconstruction; Natural scenes; Naturalistic approach; Neuroai; Reconstruction method; Training sample; Visual image; Visual image reconstruction; Large datasets; Article; artificial intelligence; brain decoding; electroencephalogram; human; image reconstruction; naturalistic approach; visual field; visual image reconstruction; brain; diagnostic imaging; image processing; physiology; procedures; Brain; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted},

In nonhuman primates, the sensitivity and resolution of cells in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and primary visual cortex (V1) also improve, but not enough to account for the perceptual changes. So, what aspects of visual system development limit visual sensitivity in infants? Improvements in behavioral sensitivity might arise from maturation of regions downstream of V1 such as V2, V4, and IT, which are thought to support increasingly complex perceptual abilities. We recorded the responses of populations of neurons in areas V1, V2, V4, and PIT to radial frequency patterns—a type of global form stimulus. Subjects were three young monkeys (two female, one male) between the ages of 19 and 54 weeks and a single adult animal (male). We found that neurons and neural populations in V4 reliably encoded global form in radial frequency stimuli at the earliest ages we studied, while V1 neurons do not. V2 and PIT populations also showed some degree of selectivity for these patterns at early ages, especially at higher radial frequency values. We did not find significant, systematic changes in neural decoding performance that could account for the improvement in behavioral performance over the same age range in an overlapping group of animals (Rodriguez Deliz et al., 2024). Finally, consistent with our prior behavioral results, neural populations in V4 show highest sensitivity for the higher radial frequency values, which contain the highest concentration of curvature and orientation cues. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {adult; animal experiment; article; contrast sensitivity; controlled study; female; infant; lateral geniculate body; Macaca; male; nerve cell; nonhuman; pattern recognition; striate cortex; vision; visual acuity; visual cortex; visual system; animal; growth, development and aging; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; rhesus monkey; Animals; Female; Macaca mulatta; Male; Neurons; Photic Stimulation; Visual Cortex},

	abstract  = {Objective. AI-based neural decoding reconstructs visual perception by leveraging generative models to map brain activity measured through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) into the observed visual stimulus. Approach. Traditionally, ridge linear models transform fMRI into a latent space, which is then decoded using variational autoencoders (VAE) or LDMs. Owing to the complexity and noisiness of fMRI data, newer approaches split the reconstruction into two sequential stages, the first one providing a rough visual approximation using a VAE, the second one incorporating semantic information through the adoption of LDM guided by contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) embeddings. This work addressed some key scientific and technical gaps of the two-stage neural decoding by: (1) implementing a gated recurrent unit-based architecture to establish a non-linear mapping between the fMRI signal and the VAE latent space, (2) optimizing the dimensionality of the VAE latent space, (3) systematically evaluating the contribution of the first reconstruction stage, and (4) analyzing the impact of different brain regions of interest (ROIs) on reconstruction quality. Main results. Experiments on the NSD, containing 73 000 unique natural images, along with fMRI of eight subjects, demonstrated that the proposed architecture maintained competitive performance while reducing the complexity of its first stage by 85%. The sensitivity analysis showcased that the first reconstruction stage is essential for preserving high structural similarity in the final reconstructions. Restricting analysis to semantic ROIs, while excluding early visual areas, diminished visual coherence, preserving semantics though. The inter-subject repeatability across ROIs was about 92% and 98% for visual and sematic metrics, respectively. Significance. This study represents a key step toward optimized neural decoding architectures leveraging non-linear models for stimulus prediction. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the interplay between the two reconstruction stages, while ROI-based analysis provided strong evidence that the two-stage AI model reflects the brain’s hierarchical processing of visual information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Brain; Brain mapping; Contrastive Learning; Decoding; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Latent semantic analysis; Neurons; Semantics; Vision; Auto encoders; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Functional magnetic resonance imaging imagery; Generative artificial intelligence; Human Visual System; Neural decoding; Region-of-interest; Regions of interest; Sensitivity analyzes; Visual stimuls; Sensitivity analysis; Visual languages; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; BOLD signal; brain blood flow; brain region; deep neural network; electroencephalogram; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Gaussian noise; human; human experiment; image reconstruction; mean absolute error; mean squared error; normal human; ridge regression; semantics; statistical model; visual information; visual stimulation; visual system; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; female; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; vision; visual cortex; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Photic Stimulation; Visual Cortex; Visual Perception; Young Adult},

	abstract  = {Reconstructing perceived images from human brain activity forms a crucial link between human and machine learning through Brain-Computer Interfaces. Early methods primarily focused on training separate models for each individual to account for individual variability in brain activity, overlooking valuable cross-subject commonalities. Recent advancements have explored multisubject methods, but these approaches face significant challenges, particularly in data privacy and effectively managing individual variability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce BRAINGUARD, a privacy-preserving collaborative training framework designed to enhance image reconstruction from multisubject fMRI data while safeguarding individual privacy. BRAINGUARD employs a collaborative global-local architecture where individual models are trained on each subject’s local data and operate in conjunction with a shared global model that captures and leverages cross-subject patterns. This architecture eliminates the need to aggregate fMRI data across subjects, thereby ensuring privacy preservation. To tackle the complexity of fMRI data, BRAINGUARD integrates a hybrid synchronization strategy, enabling individual models to dynamically incorporate parameters from the global model. By establishing a secure and collaborative training environment, BRAINGUARD not only protects sensitive brain data but also improves the image reconstructions accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRAINGUARD sets a new benchmark in both high-level and low-level metrics, advancing the state-of-the-art in brain decoding through its innovative design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely researched for neural decoding in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) as it is non-invasive, portable, and economical. However, EEG signals suffer from inter- and intra-subject variability, leading to poor performance. Recent technological advancements have led to deep learning (DL) models that have achieved high performance in various fields. However, such large models are compute- and resource-intensive and are a bottleneck for real-time neural decoding. Data distribution shift can be handled with the help of domain adaptation techniques of transfer learning (fine-tuning) and adversarial training that requires model parameter updates according to the target domain. One such recent technique is Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which requires only a small fraction of the total trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the whole model. Therefore, we explored PEFT methods for adapting EEG-based mental imagery tasks. We considered two mental imagery tasks: speech imagery and motor imagery, as both of these tasks are instrumental in post-stroke neuro-rehabilitation. We proposed a novel ensemble of weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation methods, EDoRA, for parameter-efficient mental imagery task adaptation through EEG signal classification. The performance of the proposed PEFT method is validated on two publicly available datasets, one speech imagery, and the other motor imagery dataset. In extensive experiments and analysis, the proposed method has performed better than full fine-tune and state-of-the-art PEFT methods for mental imagery EEG classification. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Adversarial machine learning; Brain mapping; Deep learning; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Learning to rank; Neurons; Transfer learning; Fine tuning; Fine-tuning methods; Imagery task; Low-rank adaptation.; Mental imagery; Neural decoding; Performance; Task adaptation; Brain computer interface},

	abstract  = {Recent fMRI-to-image approaches mainly focused on associating fMRI signals with specific conditions of pre-trained diffusion models. These approaches, while producing high-quality images, capture only a limited aspect of the complex information in fMRI signals and offer little detailed control over image creation. In contrast, this paper proposes to directly modulate the generation process of diffusion models using fMRI signals. Our approach, NeuroPictor, divides the fMRI-to-image process into three steps: i) fMRI calibrated-encoding, to tackle multi-individual pre-training for a shared latent space to minimize individual difference and enable the subsequent multi-subject training; ii) fMRI-to-image multi-subject pre-training, perceptually learning to guide diffusion model with high- and low-level conditions across different individuals; iii) fMRI-to-image single-subject refining, similar with step ii but focus on adapting to particular individual. NeuroPictor extracts high-level semantic features from fMRI signals that characterizing the visual stimulus and incrementally fine-tunes the diffusion model with a low-level manipulation network to provide precise structural instructions. By training with about 67,000 fMRI-image pairs from various individuals, our model enjoys superior fMRI-to-image decoding capacity, particularly in the within-subject setting, as evidenced in benchmark datasets.

	abstract  = {Visualizing perceived content through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis is a captivating research area in brain decoding. Previous studies have primarily focused on restoring either high-level semantic features or low-level semantic features from fMRI data, but rarely achieved effective restoration of both. This study proposes a novel approach for decoding the visual cortex activity measured by fMRI into the layered visual features that share the hierarchical information from the corresponding images. By iteratively optimizing the relationship between the layered visual features and the image’s depth features extracted by a visual transformer, the method in this research significantly improves the reconstruction of the image’s deep features. Furthermore, by incorporating the prior natural image information through a deep generator network, this work enhances the reconstruction process, resulting in richer semantic details. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our methodology in restoring both high-level and low-level semantic features of the perceived images, ultimately enhancing the overall visual fidelity of the reconstructed image. Importantly, our model demonstrates successful generalization to reconstruct artificial shapes, indicating that the performance of our model is not simply achieved by relying on extensive sample datasets.

For humans, vision is the dominant contributor to the interaction between the external environment and the brain. In this study, utilizing the retinal neural spike data collected over multi trials with visual stimuli of two movies with different levels of scene complexity, we used a neural network decoder to quantify the decoded visual stimuli with six different metrics for image quality assessment establishing comprehensive inspection of decoding. With the detailed and systematical study of the effect and single and multiple trials of data, different noise in spikes, and blurred images, our results provide an in-depth investigation of decoding dynamical visual scenes using retinal spikes.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) plays a vital role in gaining this knowledge by recording various brain regions. In this study, our primary aim was to categorize visual objects based on fMRI data during a natural scene viewing task. We intend to elucidate the challenges and limitations of previous models in order to produce a generalizable model across different subjects using advanced deep-learning methods. Materials and Methods: We’ve designed a new deep-learning model based on transformers for processing fMRI data. The model includes two blocks, the first block receives fMRI data as input and transforms the input data to a set of features called fMRI space. Simultaneously a visual space is extracted from visual images using a pre-trained inceptionv3 network. The model tries to construct the fMRI space similar to the extracted visual space. The other block is a Fully Connected (FC) network for object recognition based on fMRI space. Using transformer capabilities and an overlapping method, the proposed architecture accounts for structural changes across different voxel sizes of the subjects’ brains. Results: A unique model was trained for all subjects with different brain sizes. The results demonstrated that the proposed network achieves an impressive similarity correlation between visual space and fMRI space around 0.86 for train and 0.86 for test dataset. Furthermore, the classification accuracy was about 70.3%. These outcomes underscored the effectiveness of our fMRI transformer network in extracting features from fMRI data. Conclusion: The results indicated the potential of our model for decoding images from the brain activities of new subjects. This unveils a novel direction in image reconstruction from neural activities, an area that has remained relatively uncharted due to its inherent intricacies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Article; brain disease; brain region; brain size; convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep neural network; electric potential; electroencephalogram; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; normal human; retina image; visual field},

However, most existing approaches cannot faithfully reflect the visual contents due to insufficient image quality or semantic mismatches. Compared with reconstructing pixel-level visual images, speaking is a more efficient and effective way to explain visual information. Here we introduce a non-invasive neural decoder, termed MindGPT, which interprets perceived visual stimuli into natural languages from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, our model builds upon a visually guided neural encoder with a cross-attention mechanism. By the collaborative use of data augmentation techniques, this architecture permits us to guide latent neural representations towards a desired language semantic direction in a self-supervised fashion. Through doing so, we found that the neural representations of the MindGPT are explainable, which can be used to evaluate the contributions of visual properties to language semantics. Our experiments show that the generated word sequences truthfully represented the visual information (with essential details) conveyed in the seen stimuli. The results also suggested that with respect to language decoding tasks, the higher visual cortex (HVC) is more semantically informative than the lower visual cortex (LVC), and using only the HVC can recover most of the semantic information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Neuroimaging; Visual languages; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Language semantics; Multi-modal; Multimodal representation learning; Neural decoding; Neural representations; Text reconstruction; Visual content; Visual cortexes; Visual information; Image coding; adult; algorithm; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image processing; language; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; semantics; signal processing; vision; visual cortex; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Semantics; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Visual Cortex; Visual Perception; Young Adult},

	abstract  = {Understanding how the brain responds to external stimuli and decoding this process has been a significant challenge in neuroscience. While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain. Unfortunately, the lack of paired {brain, speech, gesture} data hinders the deployment of deep learning models for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, fMRI2GES, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using Dual Brain Decoding Alignment. This method relies on two key components: 1) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and 2) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings. We also investigate fMRI signals from different ROIs in the cortex and how they affect generation results. Overall, we provide new insights into decoding co-speech gestures, thereby advancing our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Alignment; Brain; Brain mapping; Gesture recognition; Image reconstruction; Neurophysiology; Brain decoding; Brain response; Diffusoin model; External stimulus; FMRI signal; Learning models; Neuroscience; Reconstruction networks; Speech stimuli; Textual description; Deep learning},

	abstract  = {Electroencephalography (EEG) provides high temporal resolution neural data for brain-computer interfacing via noninvasive electrophysiological recording. Estimating the internal brain activity by means of source imaging techniques can further improve the spatial resolution of EEG and enhance the reliability of neural decoding and brain-computer interaction. In this work, we propose a novel EEG data-driven source imaging scheme for precise and efficient estimation of macroscale spatiotemporal brain dynamics across thalamus and cortical regions with deep learning methods. A deep source imaging framework with a convolutional-recurrent neural network is designed to estimate the internal brain dynamics from high-density EEG recordings. Moreover, a brain model including 210 cortical regions and 16 thalamic nuclei is established based on human brain connectome to provide synthetic training data, which manifests intrinsic characteristics of underlying brain dynamics in spontaneous, stimulation-evoked, and pathological states.

	abstract  = {Background: Image reconstruction is a critical task in brain decoding research, primarily utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, due to challenges such as limited samples in fMRI data, the quality of reconstruction results often remains poor. New method: We proposed a three-stage multi-level deep fusion model (TS-ML-DFM). The model employed a three-stage training process, encompassing components such as image encoders, generators, discriminators, and fMRI encoders. In this method, we incorporated distinct supplementary features derived separately from depth images and original images. Additionally, the method integrated several components, including a random shift module, dual attention module, and multi-level feature fusion module. Results: In both qualitative and quantitative comparisons on the Horikawa17 and VanGerven10 datasets, our method exhibited excellent performance. Comparison with existing methods: For example, on the primary Horikawa17 dataset, our method was compared with other leading methods based on metrics the average hash value, histogram similarity, mutual information, structural similarity accuracy, AlexNet(2), AlexNet(5), and pairwise human perceptual similarity accuracy. Compared to the second-ranked results in each metric, the proposed method achieved improvements of 0.99 %, 3.62 %, 3.73 %, 2.45 %, 3.51 %, 0.62 %, and 1.03 %, respectively. In terms of the SwAV top-level semantic metric, a substantial improvement of 10.53 % was achieved compared to the second-ranked result in the pixel-level reconstruction methods. Conclusions: The TS-ML-DFM method proposed in this study, when applied to decoding brain visual patterns using fMRI data, has outperformed previous algorithms, thereby facilitating further advancements in research within this field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Article; brain region; comparative study; controlled study; deconvolution; functional magnetic resonance imaging; histogram; human; image reconstruction; model; multi level deep fusion model model; nonhuman; validity; brain; brain mapping; deep learning; diagnostic imaging; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; Brain; Brain Mapping; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging},

While recent studies have achieved notable results by leveraging deep generative models, challenges persist due to the lack of large-scale datasets and the inherent noise from non-invasive measurement methods. In this study, we draw inspiration from the mechanism of human memory and propose BrainRAM, a novel two-stage dual-guided framework for visual stimuli reconstruction. BrainRAM incorporates a Retrieval-Augmented Module (RAM) and diffusion prior to enhance the quality of reconstructed images from the brain. Specifically, in stage I, we transform fMRI voxels into the latent space of image and text embeddings via diffusion priors, obtaining preliminary estimates of the visual stimuli's semantics and structure. In stage II, based on previous estimates, we retrieve data from the LAION-2B-en dataset and employ the proposed RAM to refine them, yielding high-quality reconstruction results.

	abstract  = {Decoding human visual representations from brain activity data is a challenging but arguably essential task with an understanding of the real world and the human visual system. However, decoding semantically similar visual representations from brain recordings is difficult, especially for electroencephalography (EEG), which has excellent temporal resolution but suffers from spatial precision. Prevailing methods mainly focus on matching brain activity data with corresponding stimuli-responses using contrastive learning. They rely on massive and high-quality paired data and omit semantically aligned modalities distributed in distinct regions of the latent space. This paper proposes a novel Multimodal Bidirectional Cycle Consistency (MB2C) framework for learning robust visual neural representations. Specifically, we utilize dual-GAN to generate modality-related features and inversely translate back to the corresponding semantic latent space to close the modality gap and guarantee that embeddings from different modalities with similar semantics are in the same region of representation space. We perform zero-shot tasks on the ThingsEEG dataset. Additionally, we conduct EEG classification and image reconstruction on both the ThingsEEG and EEGCVPR40 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other baselines. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Contrastive Learning; Semantic Segmentation; Zero-shot learning; Brain activity; Cycle consistency; Human visual; Images reconstruction; Multi-modal; Multi-modal learning; Neural decoding; Neural representations; Real-world; Visual representations; Electroencephalography},

These brain encoders are constrained by the limited amount of paired brain and stimuli data available for training, making it challenging to learn rich neural representations. Methods: To address this limitation, we present a novel multimodal training approach using paired image and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to establish a brain masked autoencoder that learns the interactions between images and brain activities. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion model conditioned on brain data to decode realistic images. Results: Our method achieves high-quality decoding results in semantic contents and low-level visual attributes, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, our method is applied to decode artificial patterns across region of interests (ROIs) to explore their functional properties. We not only validate existing knowledge concerning ROIs but also unveil new insights, such as the synergy between early visual cortex and higher-level scene ROIs, as well as the competition within the higher-level scene ROIs.

	abstract  = {Objective. Brain decoding is a field of computational neuroscience that aims to infer mental states or internal representations of perceptual inputs from measurable brain activity. This study proposes a novel approach to brain decoding that relies on semantic and contextual similarity. Approach. We use several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of natural images as stimuli and create a deep learning decoding pipeline inspired by the bottom-up and top-down processes in human vision. Our pipeline includes a linear brain-to-feature model that maps fMRI activity to semantic visual stimuli features. We assume that the brain projects visual information onto a space that is homeomorphic to the latent space of last layer of a pretrained neural network, which summarizes and highlights similarities and differences between concepts. These features are categorized in the latent space using a nearest-neighbor strategy, and the results are used to retrieve images or condition a generative latent diffusion model to create novel images. Main results. We demonstrate semantic classification and image retrieval on three different fMRI datasets: Generic Object Decoding (vision perception and imagination), BOLD5000, and NSD. In all cases, a simple mapping between fMRI and a deep semantic representation of the visual stimulus resulted in meaningful classification and retrieved or generated images. We assessed quality using quantitative metrics and a human evaluation experiment that reproduces the multiplicity of conscious and unconscious criteria that humans use to evaluate image similarity. Our method achieved correct evaluation in over 80% of the test set. Significance. Our study proposes a novel approach to brain decoding that relies on semantic and contextual similarity. The results demonstrate that measurable neural correlates can be linearly mapped onto the latent space of a neural network to synthesize images that match the original content.

We analyzed EEG recordings from 6 participants for the ImageNet dataset and 10 for the THINGS-EEG 2 dataset, exposed to images spanning unique semantic categories. These EEG readings were converted into spectrograms, which were then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), integrated with a knowledge distillation procedure based on a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)-based image classification teacher network. This strategy allowed our model to attain a top-5 accuracy of 87%, significantly outperforming a standard CNN and various RNN-based benchmarks. Additionally, we incorporated an image reconstruction mechanism based on pre-trained latent diffusion models, which allowed us to generate an estimate of the images that had elicited EEG activity. Therefore, our architecture not only decodes images from neural activity but also offers a credible image reconstruction from EEG only, paving the way for, e.g., swift, individualized feedback experiments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Brain; Brain computer interface; Classification (of information); Convolution; Decoding; Distillation; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Image classification; Neurons; Personnel training; Semantics; BCI vision; Brain activity; Brain decoding; Convolutional neural network; Diffusion model; Electroencephalography decoding; Human brain; Images reconstruction; Research domains; Visual representations; Image reconstruction; Article; classification algorithm; classifier; clustering algorithm; comparative study; computer vision; contrastive language image pre training; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diffusion; distillation; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; follow up; human; image reconstruction; k means clustering; knowledge; knowledge distillation; latent period; logistic regression analysis; long short term memory network; measurement accuracy; probability; recurrent neural network; short time Fourier transform; signal processing; time frequency decomposition; time series analysis; visual attention; visual memory; adult; artificial neural network; brain; brain computer interface; female; image processing; male; physiology; procedures; Adult; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Neural Networks, Computer; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted},

Recent advances in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) coupled with natural language processing have enhanced communication speed and accuracy.

However, BCIs based on motor cortical activities may experience signal deterioration in users with motor cortical degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. An alternative approach to using iEEG of the motor cortex is necessary to support patients with such conditions. Approach. In this study, a multimodal embedding of text and images was used to decode visual semantic information from iEEG signals of the visual cortex to generate text and images. We used contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) embedding to represent images presented to 17 patients implanted with electrodes in the occipital and temporal cortices. A CLIP image vector was inferred from the high-γ power of the iEEG signals recorded while viewing the images. Main results. Text was generated by CLIPCAP from the inferred CLIP vector with better-than-chance accuracy. Then, an image was created from the generated text using StableDiffusion with significant accuracy.

	abstract  = {The reconstruction of visual stimuli from fMRI data represents a major technological and scientific challenge at the forefront of contemporary neuroscience research. Deep learning techniques have played a critical role in advancing decoding models for visual stimulus reconstruction from fMRI data. Particularly, the use of advanced GANs has resulted in significant improvements in the quality of image generation, providing a powerful tool for addressing the challenges of this complex task. However, none of these studies have taken into account the inherent characteristics of the stimulus contents themselves; This, in turn, leads to unsatisfactory outcomes, as demonstrated by the inconsistent identity between reconstructed faces and ground truth in the decoding of facial images. In order to tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework aimed at enhancing the accuracy of reconstructing facial images from fMRI data. Our key innovation involves extracting and disentangling multi-level visual information from brain signals in the latent space and optimizing high-level features for facial identity control using identity loss. Specifically, our framework uses StyleGAN inversion to extract hierarchical latent codes from images, which are then bridged to fMRI data through transformation blocks. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage refinement method to enhance the accuracy of reconstructed faces, which involves progressively updating fMRI latent codes with custom loss functions designed for both feature- and image-wise optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively achieves two critical objectives: (1) accurate facial image reconstruction from fMRI data and (2) preservation of identity characteristics with a high level of consistency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Data mining; Decoding; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Metadata; Brain-driven image reconstruction; Cross-modal; Facial images; fMRI data; Images reconstruction; Learning techniques; Neural decoding; Stimulus reconstruction; Stylegan inversion; Visual stimulus; Image reconstruction},

To this end, multi-unit activity (MUA) of macaque visual cortex was recorded in a passive fixation task upon presentation of faces and natural images. We analyzed the relationship between MUA and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including the conventional and feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i.e., z- and w-latents of StyleGAN, respectively) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled w representations outperform both z and CLIP representations in explaining neural responses. Further, w-latent features were found to be positioned at the higher end of the complexity gradient which indicates that they capture visual information relevant to high-level neural activity. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This field of study aims to deepen our understanding of the human brain, which is among the least understood known biological structures, and to build better foundations for brain-computer interfaces. With the success of state-of-the-art latent diffusion models in image synthesis, a trend in recent studies is to map fMRI recordings to the image embedding space of these generative models. While this method significantly improved image reconstructions in terms of semantics, preserving perceptual features without losing semantic information remains challenging, especially with complex images of natural scenes.

Inspired by the extensive information interactions in the brain, a novel graph neural network block with node–edge interaction (NEI–GNN block) is presented, which can adequately model the information exchange between brain areas via alternatively updating the nodes and edges. Additionally, to enhance the quality of reconstructed images in terms of both global structure and local detail, we employ a multi–stage reconstruction network that restricts the reconstructed images in a coarse–to–fine manner across multiple scales. Qualitative experiments on the generic object decoding (GOD) dataset demonstrate that the reconstructed images contain accurate structural information and rich texture details. Furthermore, the proposed method surpasses the existing state–of–the–art methods in terms of accuracy in the commonly used n–way evaluation. Our approach achieves 82.00%, 59.40%, 45.20% in n–way mean squared error (MSE) evaluation and 83.50%, 61.80%, 46.00% in n–way structural similarity index measure (SSIM) evaluation, respectively. Our experiments reveal the importance of information interaction among brain areas and also demonstrate the potential for developing visual–decoding brain–computer interfaces. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Article; brain region; deep learning; event related potential; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; image quality; image reconstruction; image segmentation; imagery; mean squared error; nerve cell differentiation; nerve cell network; speech perception; stimulus; support vector machine; task performance; total quality management; training},

	abstract  = {Visual images observed by humans can be reconstructed from their brain activity. However, the visualization (externalization) of mental imagery is challenging. Only a few studies have reported successful visualization of mental imagery, and their visualizable images have been limited to specific domains such as human faces or alphabetical letters. Therefore, visualizing mental imagery for arbitrary natural images stands as a significant milestone. In this study, we achieved this by enhancing a previous method. Specifically, we demonstrated that the visual image reconstruction method proposed in the seminal study by Shen et al. (2019) heavily relied on low-level visual information decoded from the brain and could not efficiently utilize the semantic information that would be recruited during mental imagery. To address this limitation, we extended the previous method to a Bayesian estimation framework and introduced the assistance of semantic information into it. Our proposed framework successfully reconstructed both seen images (i.e., those observed by the human eye) and imagined images from brain activity. Quantitative evaluation showed that our framework could identify seen and imagined images highly accurately compared to the chance accuracy (seen: 90.7%, imagery: 75.6%, chance accuracy: 50.0%). In contrast, the previous method could only identify seen images (seen: 64.3%, imagery: 50.4%). These results suggest that our framework would provide a unique tool for directly investigating the subjective contents of the brain such as illusions, hallucinations, and dreams. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Bayesian networks; Decoding; Deep neural networks; Image reconstruction; Neurophysiology; Semantics; Visualization; Bayesian estimations; Brain activity; Brain decoding; Human brain; Images reconstruction; Mental imagery; Mental images; Semantic representation; Semantics Information; Visual image; Brain; adult; Article; Bayesian network; comparative study; deep neural network; dream; electroencephalogram; female; hallucination; human; illusion; image reconstruction; male; measurement accuracy; neuroimaging; semantics; visual information; young adult; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; image processing; imagination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Bayes Theorem; Brain Mapping; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imagination; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer},

	abstract  = {Neural decoding methods provide a powerful tool for quantifying the information content of neural population codes and the limits imposed by correlations in neural activity. However, standard decoding methods are prone to overfitting and scale poorly to high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce a novel decoding method to overcome these limitations. Our approach, the gaussian process multiclass decoder (GPMD), is well suited to decoding a continuous low-dimensional variable from highdimensional population activity and provides a platform for assessing the importance of correlations in neural population codes. The GPMD is a multinomial logistic regression model with a gaussian process prior over the decoding weights. The prior includes hyperparameters that govern the smoothness of each neuron’s decoding weights, allowing automatic pruning of uninformative neurons during inference.We provide a variational inference method for fitting the GPMD to data, which scales to hundreds or thousands of neurons and performs well even in data sets with more neurons than trials. We apply the GPMD to recordings from primary visual cortex in three species: monkey, ferret, and mouse. Our decoder achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all three data sets and substantially outperforms independent Bayesian decoding, showing that knowledge of the correlation structure is essential for optimal decoding in all three species. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Recently, progress has been made in image reconstruction with non-invasive brain recordings, but it's still difficult to generate realistic images with high semantic fidelity due to the scarcity of data annotations. Unlike previous methods, this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically, under discrete OT theory, we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals, which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover, the proposed MindArt, structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches, enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information, thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so, the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance. We compare our MindArt with leading alternatives, and achieve SOTA performance in different decoding tasks. Importantly, our approach can directly generate a series of stylized 'mind snapshots' w/o extra optimizations, which may open up more potential applications.

	abstract  = {Reconstructing visual stimulus representation is a significant task in neural decoding. Until now, most studies have considered functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as the signal source. However, fMRI-based image reconstruction methods are challenging to apply widely due to the complexity and high cost of acquisition equipment. Taking into account the advantages of the low cost and easy portability of electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition equipment, we propose a novel image reconstruction method based on EEG signals in this article. First, to meet the high recognizability of visual stimulus images in a fast-switching manner, we construct a visual stimuli image dataset and obtain the corresponding EEG dataset through EEG signals collection experiment. Second, we introduce the deep visual representation model (DVRM), comprising a primary encoder and a subordinate decoder, to reconstruct visual stimuli representation. The encoder is designed based on residual-in-residual dense blocks to learn the distribution characteristics between EEG signals and visual stimulus images. Meanwhile, the decoder is designed using a deep neural network to reconstruct the visual stimulus representation from the learned deep visual representation. The DVRM can accommodate the deep and multiview visual features of the human natural state, resulting in more precise reconstructed images. Finally, we evaluate the DVRM based on the quality of the generated images using our EEG dataset. The results demonstrate that the DVRM exhibits an excellent performance in learning deep visual representation from EEG signals, generating reconstructed representation of images that are realistic and highly resemble the original images. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Amplitude modulation; Brain mapping; Deep neural networks; Image acquisition; Image reconstruction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Deep visual representation model; Electroencephalogram dataset; Electroencephalogram signals; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Image reconstruction methods; Images reconstruction; Neural decoding; Representation model; Visual representations; Visual stimulus; Electroencephalography},

In this study, we propose a novel two-stage brain coding model called "VTVBrain"that focuses on decoding key neural responses in multimodal environments. In the first stage, we built a high-dimensional multimodal latent space pre-training model using an attentional mechanism-based variational autoencoder, aiming to capture and encode the main perceptual processes of observers when faced with multimodal stimuli integrating textual and visual information. In the second stage, the Versatile Diffusion model is utilized for image reconstruction of the first stage primary representational images for high-level perception. The proposed model further refines the latent space representation approach, explores the relationship between the brain's neural responses and complex natural scenes, and provides insight into how the brain integrates and processes information from different senses at a higher level. The introduction of the VTVBrain model not only brings a new perspective to the field of neural decoding, but also has a great potential for application in the development of brain-like artificial intelligence and future cognitive neuroscience research.

Moreover, the complexity inherent to fMRI data, characterized by high dimensionality and low signal-to-noise ratio, poses significant challenges in extracting meaningful visual information for perceptual reconstruction. In this regard, we proposes a novel neural decoding model, named the hierarchical semantic generative adversarial network (HS-GAN), inspired by the hierarchical encoding of the visual cortex and the homology theory of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which is capable of reconstructing perceptual images from fMRI data by leveraging the hierarchical and semantic representations. The experimental results demonstrate that HS-GAN achieved the best performance on Horikawa2017 dataset (histogram similarity: 0.447, SSIM-Acc: 78.9%, Peceptual-Acc: 95.38%, AlexNet(2): 96.24% and AlexNet(5): 94.82%) over existing advanced methods, indicating improved naturalness and fidelity of the reconstructed image. The versatility of the HS-GAN was also highlighted, as it demonstrated promising generalization capabilities in reconstructing handwritten digits, achieving the highest SSIM (0.783±0.038), thus extending its application beyond training solely on natural images. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Brain; Decoding; Deep learning; Encoding (symbols); Functional neuroimaging; Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; Network coding; Neural networks; Semantic Web; Semantics; Signal to noise ratio; Brain activity; Features extraction; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Images reconstruction; Reconstructed image; Resonance imaging data; Visual decoding; Image reconstruction; Article; attention network; convolutional neural network; electroencephalogram; functional magnetic resonance imaging; generative adversarial network; Hierarchical Encoder; image analysis; image reconstruction; image segmentation; information processing; lateral geniculate body; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; nerve cell network; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; retina image; semantics; structural homology; visual image reconstruction; visual selective attention; artificial neural network; brain; human; image processing; procedures; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer},

However, most of these studies focus on classifying a limited number of image categories or reconstructing visual images with additional information, e.g., semantic categories and textual cues. Constraint-free visual reconstruction remains scarce. Here, we propose a generative network based on the functional diversity of the human visual cortex (FDGen) that takes multivariate brain activity as input and directly reconstructs natural images perceived by observers without any additional cues (semantic categories or textual description). Our FDGen is augmented by two bio-inspired computational modules. Based on the functional specializations of the human visual cortex, we propose a new function-based input module (FIM) that projects responses from different brain regions into separate feature spaces. Second, inspired by human attention, we construct a computational module to derive attentive feature weights at the function level to refine the feature map. These function-selection modules (FSMs) allow the network to dynamically select multiscale visual information during the generation process. We test FDGen on the popular fMRI datasets of natural images and achieve highly robust performance.

	abstract  = {Reconstructing visual stimuli from brain activity is a challenging problem, particu-larly when using EEG data, which is more affordable and accessible than fMRI but noisier and lower in spatial resolution. In this paper, we present Hierarchical-ViT, a novel framework designed to improve the quality and precision of EEG-based image reconstruction by integrating hierarchical visual feature extraction, vision transformer-based EEG (EEG-ViT) processing, and CLIP-based joint learning. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of the human visual system, our model progressively captures complex visual features—such as edges, textures, and shapes—through a multi-stage processing approach. These features are aligned with EEG signals processed by the EEG-ViT model, allowing for the creation of a shared latent space that enhances contrastive learning. A StyleGAN is then em-ployed to generate high-resolution images from these aligned representations. We evaluated our method on two benchmark datasets, EEGCVPR40 and ThoughtViz, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches in terms of Inception Score (IS), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for EEGCVPR, and IS and KID for the ThoughtViz dataset. Through an ablation study, we underscored the feasibility of hierarchical feature extraction, while the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test confirmed the distinctiveness of the learned feature spaces. In conclusion, our results show the feasibility and uniqueness of using hierarchical filtering of perceived images combined with EEG-ViT-based features to improve brain decoding from EEG data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Previous studies tend to emphasize reconstructing pixel-level features (contours, colors, etc.) or semantic features (object category) of the stimulus image, but typically, these properties are not reconstructed together. In this context, we introduce a novel three-stage visual reconstruction approach called the Dual-guided Brain Diffusion Model (DBDM). Initially, we employ the Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) to reconstruct a coarse image from fMRI data, capturing the underlying details of the original image. Subsequently, the Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP) model is utilized to provide a semantic annotation for each image. Finally, the image-to-image generation pipeline of the Versatile Diffusion (VD) model is utilized to recover natural images from the fMRI patterns guided by both visual and semantic information. The experimental results demonstrate that DBDM surpasses previous approaches in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. In particular, the best performance is achieved by DBDM in reconstructing the semantic details of the original image; the Inception, CLIP and SwAV distances are 0.611, 0.225 and 0.405, respectively. This confirms the efficacy of our model and its potential to advance visual decoding research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {Objective. Development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is key for enabling communication in individuals who have lost the faculty of speech due to severe motor paralysis. A BCI control strategy that is gaining attention employs speech decoding from neural data. Recent studies have shown that a combination of direct neural recordings and advanced computational models can provide promising results. Understanding which decoding strategies deliver best and directly applicable results is crucial for advancing the field. Approach. In this paper, we optimized and validated a decoding approach based on speech reconstruction directly from high-density electrocorticography recordings from sensorimotor cortex during a speech production task. Main results. We show that (1) dedicated machine learning optimization of reconstruction models is key for achieving the best reconstruction performance; (2) individual word decoding in reconstructed speech achieves 92%-100% accuracy (chance level is 8%); (3) direct reconstruction from sensorimotor brain activity produces intelligible speech. Significance. These results underline the need for model optimization in achieving best speech decoding results and highlight the potential that reconstruction-based speech decoding from sensorimotor cortex can offer for development of next-generation BCI technology for communication. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Audio recordings; Brain; Brain computer interface; Decoding; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Learning systems; Neurophysiology; Speech communication; Audio reconstruction; Brain activity; Electrocorticography; Interface control; Interface technology; Learning models; Neural decoding; Sensorimotor cortex; Sensorimotors; Speech decoding; Deep neural networks; adult; Article; artificial neural network; audio recording; classification algorithm; comparative study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; electrocorticography; electroencephalogram; female; human; human tissue; image reconstruction; leave one out cross validation; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; male; middle aged; multilayer perceptron; normal human; random forest; recurrent neural network; sensorimotor cortex; speech analysis; speech intelligibility; speech perception; word recognition; young adult; interpersonal communication; procedures; speech; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Communication; Deep Learning; Humans; Sensorimotor Cortex; Speech},

	abstract  = {Complete reaching movements involve target sensing, motor planning, and arm movement execution, and this process requires the integration and communication of various brain regions. Previously, reaching movements have been decoded successfully from the motor cortex (M1) and applied to prosthetic control. However, most studies attempted to decode neural activities from a single brain region, resulting in reduced decoding accuracy during visually guided reaching motions. To enhance the decoding accuracy of visually guided forelimb reaching movements, we propose a parallel computing neural network using both M1 and medial agranular cortex (AGm) neural activities of rats to predict forelimb-reaching movements. The proposed network decodes M1 neural activities into the primary components of the forelimb movement and decodes AGm neural activities into internal feedforward information to calibrate the forelimb movement in a goal-reaching movement. We demonstrate that using AGm neural activity to calibrate M1 predicted forelimb movement can improve decoding performance significantly compared to neural decoders without calibration. We also show that the M1 and AGm neural activities contribute to controlling forelimb movement during goal-reaching movements, and we report an increase in the power of the local field potential (LFP) in beta and gamma bands over AGm in response to a change in the target distance, which may involve sensorimotor transformation and communication between the visual cortex and AGm when preparing for an upcoming reaching movement. The proposed parallel computing neural network with the internal feedback model improves prediction accuracy for goal-reaching movements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Brain; Electrophysiology; Feedback; Forecasting; Neurons; Brain regions; Cortexes; Goal-reaching movement; Internal feedback; Medial agranular cortex; Neural activity; Neural decoding; Primary motor cortex; Reaching movements; Target distance; Decoding; animal; feedback system; forelimb; motivation; movement (physiology); physiology; upper limb; Animals; Forelimb; Goals; Movement; Upper Extremity},

	abstract  = {Reconstructing visual stimulus from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a challenging decoding task for revealing the visual system. Recent deep learning approaches commonly neglect the relationship between hierarchical image features and different regions of the visual cortex, and fail to use global and local image features in reconstructing visual stimulus. To address these issues, in this article, a novel neural decoding framework is proposed by using a dual attention (DA) hierarchical latent generative network with multiscale feature fusion (DA-HLGN-MSFF) method. Specifically, the fMRI data are first encoded to hierarchical features of our image encoder network, which employs a multikernel convolution block to extract the multiscale spatial information of images. In order to reconstruct the perceived images and further improve the performance of our generator network, a DA block based on the channel-spatial attention mechanism is then proposed to exploit the interchannel relationships and spatial long-range dependencies of features. Moreover, a multiscale feature fusion block is finally adopted to aggregate the global and local information of features at different scales and synthesize the final reconstructed images in the generator network. Competitive experimental results on two public fMRI data sets demonstrate that our method is able to achieve promising reconstructing performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

In this study, a dimotif lattice paradigm that can adjust the strength of one grouping principle was used to inspect how, when, and where the processing of two grouping principles (proximity and similarity) were carried out in human brain. Our psychophysical findings demonstrated that similarity grouping effect was enhanced with reduced proximity effect when the grouping cues of proximity and similarity were presented simultaneously. Meanwhile, EEG decoding was performed to reveal the specific cognitive patterns involved in each principle by using time-resolved MVPA. More importantly, the onsets of dissociation between 2 grouping principles coincided within 3 time windows: the early-stage proximity-defined local visual element arrangement in middle occipital cortex, the middle-stage processing for feature selection modulating low-level visual cortex such as inferior occipital cortex and fusiform cortex, and the high-level cognitive integration to make decisions for specific grouping preference in the parietal areas. In addition, it was discovered that the brain responses were highly correlated with behavioral grouping. Therefore, our study provides direct evidence for a link between the human perceptual space of grouping decision-making and neural space of brain activation patterns. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {article; brain cortex; decision making; dissociation; electroencephalogram; feature selection; human; human experiment; occipital cortex; vision; visual cortex},

	abstract  = {The relationship between human visual experience and evoked neural activity is central to the field of computational neuroscience. The purpose of visual neural encoding and decoding is to study the relationship between visual stimuli and the evoked neural activity by using neuroimaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neural encoding researches attempt to predict the brain activity according to the presented external stimuli, which contributes to the development of brain science and brain-like artificial intelligence. Neural decoding researches attempt to predict the information about external stimuli by analyzing the observed brain activities, which can interpret the state of human visual perception and promote the development of brain computer interface (BCI). Therefore, fMRI based visual neural encoding and decoding researches have important scientific significance and engineering value. Typically, the encoding models are based on the specific computations that are thought to underlie the observed brain responses for specific visual stimuli. Early studies of visual neural encoding relied heavily on Gabor wavelet features because these features are very good at modeling brain responses in the primary visual cortex. Recently, given the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in classifying objects in natural images, the representations within these networks have been used to build encoding models of cortical responses to complex visual stimuli. Most of the existing decoding studies are based on multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) method, but brain connectivity pattern is also a key feature of the brain state and can be used for brain decoding. Although recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of decoding the identity of binary contrast patterns, handwritten characters, human facial images, natural picture/video stimuli and dreams from the corresponding brain activation patterns, the accurate reconstruction of the visual stimuli from fMRI still lacks adequate examination and requires plenty of efforts to improve. On the basis of summarizing the key technologies and research progress of fMRI based visual neural encoding and decoding, this paper further analyzes the limitations of existing visual neural encoding and decoding methods. In terms of visual neural encoding, the development process of population receptive field (pRF) estimation method is introduced in detail. In terms of visual neural decoding, it is divided into semantic classification, image identification and image reconstruction according to task types, and the representative research work of each part and the methods used are described in detail. From the perspective of machine learning, semantic classification is a single label or multi-label classification problem. Simple visual stimuli only contain a single object, while natural visual stimuli often contain multiple semantic labels. For example, an image may contain flowers, water, trees, cars, etc. Predicting one or more semantic labels of the visual stimulus from the brain signal is called semantic decoding. Image retrieval based on brain signal is also a common visual decoding task where the model is created to “decode” neural activity by retrieving a picture of what a person has just seen or imagined. In particular, the reconstruction techniques of simple image, face image and complex natural image based on deep generative models (including variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs)) are introduced in the part of image reconstruction. Secondly, 10 open source datasets commonly used in this field were statistically sorted out, and the sample size, number of subjects, types of stimuli, research purposes and download links of the datasets were summarized in detail. These datasets have made important contributions to the development of this field. Finally, we introduce the commonly used measurement metrics of visual neural encoding and decoding model in detail, analyze the shortcomings of current visual neural encoding and decoding methods, propose feasible suggestions for improvement, and show the future development directions. Specifically, for neural encoding, the existing methods still have the following shortcomings: 1) the computational models are mostly based on the existing neural network architecture, which cannot reflect the real biological visual information flow; 2) due to the selective attention of each person in the visual perception and the inevitable noise in the fMRI data collection, individual differences are significant; 3) the sample size of the existing fMRI data set is insufficient; 4) most researchers construct feature spaces of neural encoding models based on fixed types of pre-trained neural networks (such as AlexNet), causing problems such as insufficient diversity of visual features. On the other hand, although the existing visual neural decoding methods perform well in the semantic classification and image identification tasks, it is still very difficult to establish an accurate mapping between visual stimuli and visual neural signals, and the results of image reconstruction are often blurry and lack of clear semantics. Moreover, most of the existing visual neural decoding methods are based on linear transformation or deep network transformation of visual images, lacking exploration of new visual features. Factors that hinder researchers from effectively decoding visual information and reconstructing images or videos mainly include high dimension of fMRI data, small sample size and serious noise. In the future, more advanced artificial intelligence technology should be used to develop more effective methods of neural encoding and decoding, and try to translate brain signals into images, video, voice, text and other multimedia content, so as to achieve more BCI applications. The significant research directions include 1) multi-modal neural encoding and decoding based on the union of image and text; 2) brain-guided computer vision model training and enhancement; 3) visual neural encoding and decoding based on the high efficient features of large-scale pre-trained models. In addition, since brain signals are characterized by complexity, high dimension, large individual diversity, high dynamic nature and small sample size, future research needs to combine computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence theories to develop visual neural encoding and decoding methods with higher robustness, adaptability and interpretability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Many methods of reconstructing visual stimulus images mainly focus on how to use deep learning to classify the brain activities measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging or identify visual stimulus images. Accurate reconstruction of visual stimulus images by using deep learning still remains challenging. This paper proposes an improved deep generative multiview model to further promote the accuracy of reconstructing visual stimulus images. Firstly, an encoder based on residual-in-residual dense blocks is designed to fit the deep and multiview visual features of human natural state, and extract the features of visual stimulus images. Secondly, the structure of original decoder is extended to a deeper network in the deep generative multiview model, which makes the features obtained by each deconvolution layer more distinguishable. Finally, we configure the parameters of the optimizer and compare the performance of various optimizers under different parameter values, and then the one with the best performance is chosen and adopted to the whole model. The performance evaluations conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that the improved model has more accurate reconstruction effectiveness than the original deep generative multiview model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {accuracy; Article; deconvolution; deep learning; electroencephalogram; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; image reconstruction; visual stimulation; brain; diagnostic imaging; head; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Brain; Head; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging},

	abstract  = {Every day, the human brain processes an immense volume of visual information, relying on intricate neural mechanisms to perceive and interpret these stimuli. Recent breakthroughs in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have enabled scientists to extract visual information from human brain activity patterns. In this study, we present an innovative method for decoding brain activity into meaningful images and captions, with a specific focus on brain captioning due to its enhanced flexibility as compared to brain decoding into images. Our approach takes advantage of cutting-edge image captioning models and incorporates a unique image reconstruction pipeline that utilizes latent diffusion models and depth estimation. We utilized the Natural Scenes Dataset, a comprehensive fMRI dataset from eight subjects who viewed images from the COCO dataset. We employed the Generative Image-to-text Transformer (GIT) as our backbone for captioning and propose a new image reconstruction pipeline based on latent diffusion models. The method involves training regularized linear regression models between brain activity and extracted features. Additionally, we incorporated depth maps from the ControlNet model to further guide the reconstruction process. We propose a multimodal based approach that leverages similarities between neural and deep learning representations and by learning alignment between these spaces, we produce textual description and image reconstruction from brain activity. We evaluate our methods using quantitative metrics for both generated captions and images. Our brain captioning approach outperforms existing methods, while our image reconstruction pipeline generates plausible images with improved spatial relationships. In conclusion, we demonstrate significant progress in brain decoding, showcasing the enormous potential of integrating vision and language to better understand human cognition. Our approach provides a flexible platform for future research, with potential applications based on a combination of high-level semantic information coming from text and low-level image shape information coming from depth maps and initial guess images. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our architecture uses Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (HVAEs) to learn meaningful representations of real-world images and leverages their latent space hierarchy to learn voxel-to-image mappings. By mapping the early stages of the visual pathway to the first set of latent variables and the higher visual cortex areas to the deeper layers in the latent hierarchy, we are able to construct a latent variable neural decoding model that replicates the hierarchical visual information processing.

	abstract  = {In the field of brain-computer interface (BCI), brain decoding using electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential direction, and motion imagery EEG-based BCI can not only help rehabilitation of patients with physical disabilities, but also enhance the endurance and power of people. Most of the existing MI-based BCI studies are limited to discrete EEG classification or 3-D directional limb trajectory reconstruction. To suitable for the requirements of BCI systems in practical applications, here, we explored the decoding of trajectories of continuous nondirectional motion imagination in 3-D space based on Chinese sign language. We propose a motion imagery trajectory reconstruction Transformer (MITRT) model to decode the EEG signals of the subjects performing motion imagery, and obtain the positional changes in the 3-D space of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist skeleton points in the neural activity. We add the geometric constraint features of upper limb skeleton points to the model, and the MITRT decoding model can obtain prior knowledge to improve the reconstruction accuracy of spatial positions. To verify the decoding performance of our proposed model, we collected motor imagery (MI) EEG signals of 20 subjects based on Chinese sign language for experiments.

	abstract  = {Reaching out the function of the brain in perceiving input data from the outside world is one of the great targets of neuroscience. Neural decoding helps us to model the connection between brain activities and the visual stimulation. The reconstruction of images from brain activity can be achieved through this modelling. Recent studies have shown that brain activity is impressed by visual saliency, the important parts of an image stimuli. In this paper, a deep model is proposed to reconstruct the image stimuli from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings via visual saliency. To this end, the proposed geometric deep network-based generative adversarial network (GDN-GAN) is trained to map the EEG signals to the visual saliency maps corresponding to each image. The first part of the proposed GDN-GAN consists of Chebyshev graph convolutional layers. The input of the GDN part of the proposed network is the functional connectivity-based graph representation of the EEG channels. The output of the GDN is imposed to the GAN part of the proposed network to reconstruct the image saliency. The proposed GDN-GAN is trained using the Google Colaboratory Pro platform. The saliency metrics validate the viability and efficiency of the proposed saliency reconstruction network. The weights of the trained network are used as initial weights to reconstruct the grayscale image stimuli. The proposed network realizes the image reconstruction from EEG signals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {Optic flow provides rich information about world-relative self-motion and is used by many animals to guide movement. For example, self-motion along linear, straight paths without eye movements, generates optic flow that radiates from a singularity that specifies the direction of travel (heading). Many neural models of optic flow processing contain heading detectors that are tuned to the position of the singularity, the design of which is informed by brain area MSTd of primate visual cortex that has been linked to heading perception. Such biologically inspired models could be useful for efficient self-motion estimation in robots, but existing systems are tailored to the limited scenario of linear self-motion and neglect sensitivity to self-motion along more natural curvilinear paths. The observer in this case experiences more complex motion patterns, the appearance of which depends on the radius of the curved path (path curvature) and the direction of gaze. Indeed, MSTd neurons have been shown to exhibit tuning to optic flow patterns other than radial expansion, a property that is rarely captured in neural models. We investigated in a computational model whether a population of MSTd-like sensors tuned to radial, spiral, ground, and other optic flow patterns could support the accurate estimation of parameters describing both linear and curvilinear self-motion. We used deep learning to decode self-motion parameters from the signals produced by the diverse population of MSTd-like units. We demonstrate that this system is capable of accurately estimating curvilinear path curvature, clockwise/counterclockwise sign, and gaze direction relative to the path tangent in both synthetic and naturalistic videos of simulated self-motion. Estimates remained stable over time while rapidly adapting to dynamic changes in the observer's curvilinear self-motion. Our results show that coupled biologically inspired and artificial neural network systems hold promise as a solution for robust vision-based self-motion estimation in robots. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Biomimetics; Decoding; Eye movements; Flow patterns; Motion estimation; Neural networks; Optical flows; Biologically-inspired; Curvilinear path; Deep learning; Heading; Neural decoding; Neural modelling; Optic flow; Path curvature; Self motion; Self-motion estimation; animal; motion; movement perception; nerve cell; optic flow; physiology; visual cortex; Animals; Motion; Motion Perception; Neurons; Optic Flow; Visual Cortex},

Using a different number of feature dimensions during feature selection induces a significant difference in the decoding performance at the high layers. Moreover, the shallow neural network achieves higher accuracies at the high layers.

Existing methods ignore the structural information underlying the brain activities and the visual features, which severely limits their performance and interpretability. Here, we propose a hierarchically structured neural decoding framework by using multitask transfer learning of deep neural network (DNN) representations and a matrix-variate Gaussian prior. Our framework consists of two stages, Voxel2Unit and Unit2Pixel. In Voxel2Unit, we decode the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to the intermediate features of a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN). In Unit2Pixel, we further invert the predicted CNN features back to the visual images. Matrix-variate Gaussian prior allows us to take into account the structures between feature dimensions and between regression tasks, which are useful for improving decoding effectiveness and interpretability. This is in contrast with the existing single-output regression models that usually ignore these structures. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world fMRI data sets, and the results show that our method can predict CNN features more accurately and reconstruct the perceived natural images and faces with higher quality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Brain; Decoding; Deep neural networks; Functional neuroimaging; Image reconstruction; Matrix algebra; Neurophysiology; Regression analysis; Brain activity; Convolutional neural network; Deep neural network; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Images reconstruction; Multi-output; Multioutput regression; Network representation; Neural decoding; Magnetic resonance imaging; article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; retina image; transfer of learning},

Visual images projected on the retina change abruptly during rapid ballistic eye movements (saccades), but our perception of the visual world is continuous. To generate a stable visual perception, the spatiotemporal sensitivity of visual neurons needs to change quickly prior to and during saccades. This study uses a modeling framework to characterize the fast dynamics of neuronal responses across saccades, thereby quantifying the contribution of perisaccadic response dynamics to the readout of location information during saccades. We apply this approach to neuronal responses recorded from the visual cortex of nonhuman primates during a visually-guided saccade task with visual stimulations. Using the model-predicted responses and a classification method, we measure the spatial discriminability performance of neurons at pre-saccadic and post-saccadic receptive field locations. Characterizing the readout of perisaccadic spatial information and its precise time course can provide insights into how neurons integrate spatial information across saccades to generate a continuous visual experience. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Location; Mammals; Neurons; Computational modelling; Location information; Neural decoding; Neural response; Neuronal response; Spatial informations; Visual cortexes; Visual image; Visual information; Visual world; Eye movements},

	abstract  = {The reconstruction of visual stimulus images from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has received extensive attention in recent years, which provides a possibility to interpret the human brain. Due to the high-dimensional and high-noise characteristics of fMRI data, how to extract stable, reliable and useful information from fMRI data for image reconstruction has become a challenging problem. Inspired by the mechanism of human visual attention, in this paper, we propose a novel method of reconstructing visual stimulus images, which first decodes human visual salient region from fMRI, we define human visual salient region as foreground attention (F-attention), and then reconstructs the visual images guided by F-attention. Because the human brain is strongly wound into sulci and gyri, some spatially adjacent voxels are not connected in practice. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the global information when decoding fMRI, so we introduce the self-attention module for capturing global information into the process of decoding F-attention. In addition, in order to obtain more loss constraints in the training process of encoder-decoder, we also propose a new training strategy called Loop-Enc-Dec. The experimental results show that the F-attention decoder decodes the visual attention from fMRI successfully, and the Loop-Enc-Dec guided by F-attention can also well reconstruct the visual stimulus images. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Behavioral research; Brain; Decoding; Functional neuroimaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Foreground-attention; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Global informations; Human brain; Human visual; Neural decoding; Resonance imaging data; Salient regions; Visual reconstruction; Visual stimulus; Image reconstruction},

Prior studies had success in reconstructing either the low-level image features or the semantic/high-level aspects, but rarely both. In this study, we utilized an Instance-Conditioned GAN (IC-GAN) model to reconstruct images from fMRI patterns with both accurate semantic attributes and preserved low-level details. The IC-GAN model takes as input a 119-dim noise vector and a 2048-dim instance feature vector extracted from a target image via a self-supervised learning model (SwAV ResNet-50); these instance features act as a conditioning for IC-GAN image generation, while the noise vector introduces variability between samples. We trained ridge regression models to predict instance features, noise vectors, and dense vectors (the output of the first dense layer of the IC-GAN generator) of stimuli from corresponding fMRI patterns. Then, we used the IC-GAN generator to reconstruct novel test images based on these fMRI-predicted variables. The generated images presented state-of-the-art results in terms of capturing the semantic attributes of the original test images while remaining relatively faithful to low-level image details. Finally, we use the learned regression model and the IC-GAN generator to systematically explore and visualize the semantic features that maximally drive each of several regions-of-interest in the human brain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Brain computer interface; Decoding; Integrated circuits; Regression analysis; Semantics; Timing circuits; Vectors; FMRI decoding; Images reconstruction; Instance-conditioned GAN; Natural image reconstruction; Natural images; Neural decoding; Noise vectors; Regression modelling; Semantic attribute; Test images; Image reconstruction},

The neurons that encode these relevant signals typically constitute a nonlinear population code. Here we present a theoretical framework for quantifying how the brain uses or decodes its nonlinear information. Our theory obeys fundamental mathematical limitations on information content inherited from the sensory periphery, describing redundant codes when there are many more cortical neurons than primary sensory neurons. The theory predicts that if the brain uses its nonlinear population codes optimally, then more informative patterns should be more correlated with choices. More specifically, the theory predicts a simple, easily computed quantitative relationship between fluctuating neural activity and behavioral choices that reveals the decoding efficiency. This relationship holds for optimal feedforward networks of modest complexity, when experiments are performed under natural nuisance variation. We analyze recordings from primary visual cortex of monkeys discriminating the distribution from which oriented stimuli were drawn, and find these data are consistent with the hypothesis of near-optimal nonlinear decoding. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Present rapid development of artificial intelligence makes it feasible to decode the neural signals of human visual activities. In this paper, a novel Progressive Transfer Language Decoding Model (PT-LDM) is proposed to decode visual fMRI signals into phrases or sentences when natural images are being watched. The PT-LDM consists of an image-encoder, a fMRI encoder and a language-decoder. The results showed that phrases and sentences were successfully generated from visual activities. Similarity analysis showed that three often-used evaluation indexes BLEU, ROUGE and CIDEr reached 0.182, 0.197 and 0.680 averagely between the generated texts and the corresponding annotated texts in the testing set respectively, significantly higher than the baseline. Moreover, we found that higher visual areas usually had better performance than lower visual areas and the contribution curve of visual response patterns in language decoding varied at successively different time points. Our findings demonstrate that the neural representations elicited in visual cortices when scenes are being viewed have already contained semantic information that can be utilized to generate human language.

We used model-based fMRI to estimate the impact of distracting visual tasks on working memory representations in several visual field maps in visual and frontoparietal association cortex. Here, we show distraction causes the fidelity of working memory representations to briefly dip when both the memorandum and distractor are jointly encoded by the population activities. Distraction induces small biases in memory errors which can be predicted by biases in neural decoding in early visual cortex, but not other regions. Although distraction briefly disrupts working memory representations, the widespread redundancy with which working memory information is encoded may protect against catastrophic loss. In early visual cortex, the neural representation of information in working memory and behavioral performance are intertwined, solidifying its importance in visual memory. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {Recent advances in brain decoding have made it possible to classify image categories based on neural activity. Increasing numbers of studies have further attempted to reconstruct the image itself. However, because images of objects and scenes inherently involve spatial layout information, the reconstruction usually requires retinotopically organized neural data with high spatial resolution, such as fMRI signals. In contrast, spatial layout does not matter in the perception of “texture,” which is known to be represented as spatially global image statistics in the visual cortex. This property of “texture” enables us to reconstruct the perceived image from EEG signals, which have a low spatial resolution. Here, we propose an MVAE-based approach for reconstructing texture images from visual evoked potentials measured from observers viewing natural textures such as the textures of various surfaces and object ensembles. This approach allowed us to reconstruct images that perceptually resemble the original textures with a photographic appearance. The present approach can be used as a method for decoding the highly detailed “impression” of sensory stimuli from brain activity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Brain; Decoding; Electrophysiology; Image coding; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Image texture; Network coding; Neurons; Textures; Auto encoders; Brain decoding; Deep neural network; EEG signals; Multi-modal; Multimodal variational auto encoder; Object and scenes; Photo-realistic; Spatial layout; Visual texture; Deep neural networks; article; autoencoder; brain function; deep neural network; electroencephalogram; human; perception; visual cortex; visual evoked potential},

	abstract  = {Achievement of human-level image recognition by deep neural networks (DNNs) has spurred interest in whether and how DNNs are brain-like. Both DNNs and the visual cortex perform hierarchical processing, and correspondence has been shown between hierarchical visual areas and DNN layers in representing visual features. Here, we propose the brain hierarchy (BH) score as a metric to quantify the degree of hierarchical correspondence based on neural decoding and encoding analyses where DNN unit activations and human brain activity are predicted from each other. We find that BH scores for 29 pre-trained DNNs with various architectures are negatively correlated with image recognition performance, thus indicating that recently developed high-performance DNNs are not necessarily brain-like. Experimental manipulations of DNN models suggest that single-path sequential feedforward architecture with broad spatial integration is critical to brain-like hierarchy. Our method may provide new ways to design DNNs in light of their representational homology to the brain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, due to the limitations of sample size and the lack of an effective reconstruction model, accurate reconstruction of natural images is still a major challenge. The current, rapid development of deep learning models provides the possibility of overcoming these obstacles. Here, we propose a deep learning-based framework that includes a latent feature extractor, a latent feature decoder, and a natural image generator, to achieve the accurate reconstruction of natural images from brain activity. The latent feature extractor is used to extract the latent features of natural images. The latent feature decoder predicts the latent features of natural images based on the response signals from the higher visual cortex. The natural image generator is applied to generate reconstructed images from the predicted latent features of natural images and the response signals from the visual cortex. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations were conducted with test images. The results showed that the reconstructed image achieved comparable, accurate reproduction of the presented image in both high-level semantic category information and low-level pixel information.

	abstract  = {Background: Neural decoding could be useful in many ways, from serving as a neuroscience research tool to providing a means of augmented communication for patients with neurological conditions. However, applications of decoding are currently constrained by the limitations of traditional neuroimaging modalities. Electrocorticography requires invasive neurosurgery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is too cumbersome for uses like daily communication, and alternatives like functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer poor image quality. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is an emerging modality that uses denser optode arrays than fNIRS to combine logistical advantages of optical neuroimaging with enhanced image quality. Despite the resulting promise of HD-DOT for facilitating field applications of neuroimaging, decoding of brain activity as measured by HD-DOT has yet to be evaluated. Objective: To assess the feasibility and performance of decoding with HD-DOT in visual cortex. Methods and Results: To establish the feasibility of decoding at the single-trial level with HD-DOT, a template matching strategy was used to decode visual stimulus position. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to quantify the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of binary visual decoding. Mean areas under the curve (AUCs) greater than 0.97 across 10 imaging sessions in a highly sampled participant were observed. ROC analyses of decoding across 5 participants established both reproducibility in multiple individuals and the feasibility of inter-individual decoding (mean AUCs > 0.7), although decoding performance varied between individuals. Phase-encoded checkerboard stimuli were used to assess more complex, non-binary decoding with HD-DOT. Across 3 highly sampled participants, the phase of a 60° wide checkerboard wedge rotating 10° per second through 360° was decoded with a within-participant error of 25.8±24.7°. Decoding between participants was also feasible based on permutation-based significance testing. Conclusions: Visual stimulus information can be decoded accurately, reproducibly, and across a range of detail (for both binary and non-binary outcomes) at the single-trial level (without needing to block-average test data) using HD-DOT data. These results lay the foundation for future studies of more complex decoding with HD-DOT and applications in clinical populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {adult; area under the curve; article; brain function; clinical article; controlled study; feasibility study; female; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; functional neuroimaging; human; human experiment; human tissue; image quality; male; optical tomography; quantitative analysis; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; visual cortex; visual information; visual stimulation; image processing; middle aged; physiology; procedures; vision; Adult; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Tomography, Optical; Visual Perception},

	abstract  = {Decoding visual stimuli from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is of great significance for understanding the neural mechanism of the visual information processing in the human brain. How to extract effective information from massive voxel data in the brain to predict the brain state is a problem worth discussing in fMRI. However, the inherent characteristics of small quantity and high dimensionality in fMRI data limited the performance of brain decoding. As an effective way to acquire visual information, people usually compare with the prior knowledge learned when recognizing objects, and does not need to have a complete understanding of visual information. In this paper, we proposed a new visual classification model to decode the stimulus categories from the visual information of the brain based on the triplet network. The triplet network is a model framework with a comparison mechanism similar to that of human visual recognition objects, contains three-branches weight sharing subnetworks, which are composed of fully connected networks in our model. Our results showed that the decoding accuracy is 57.5±1.86% and 44.17±1.31% for S1 and S2, respectively. S1 was about 6% higher than the best traditional machine learning classifier SVM, while S2 was nearly 3.5% higher than SVM.

	abstract  = {Visual perceptual decoding is one of the important and challenging topics in cognitive neuroscience. Building a mapping model between visual response signals and visual contents is the key point of decoding. Most previous studies used peak response signals to decode object categories. However, brain activities measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging are a dynamic process with time dependence, so peak signals cannot fully represent the whole process, which may affect the performance of decoding. Here, we propose a decoding model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network to decode five object categories from multitime response signals evoked by natural images. Experimental results show that the average decoding accuracy using the multitime (2–6 s) response signals is 0.540 from the five subjects, which is significantly higher than that using the peak ones (6 s; accuracy: 0.492; p '.05). In addition, from the perspective of different durations, methods and visual areas, the decoding performances of the five object categories are deeply and comprehensively explored. The analysis of different durations and decoding methods reveals that the LSTM-based decoding model with sequence simulation ability can fit the time dependence of the multitime visual response signals to achieve higher decoding performance. The comparative analysis of different visual areas demonstrates that the higher visual cortex (VC) contains more semantic category information needed for visual perceptual decoding than lower VC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {adult; article; controlled study; deep learning; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; long short term memory network; major clinical study; male; simulation; visual cortex; brain mapping; concept formation; diagnostic imaging; long term memory; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pattern recognition; physiology; short term memory; theoretical model; young adult; Adult; Brain Mapping; Concept Formation; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Long-Term; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Theoretical; Nerve Net; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Visual Cortex; Young Adult},

Due to the complexity of visual stimuli and the constraints of fMRI data collection, the present decoding methods can only reconstruct the basic outline or provide similar figures/features of the perceived natural stimuli. To achieve a high-quality and high-resolution reconstruction of natural images from brain activity, this paper presents an end-to-end perception reconstruction model called the similarity-conditions generative adversarial network (SC-GAN), where visually perceptible images are reconstructed based on human visual cortex responses. The SC-GAN extracts the high-level semantic features of natural images and corresponding visual cortical responses and then introduces the semantic features as conditions of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to realize the perceptual reconstruction of visual images. The experimental results show that the semantic features extracted from SC-GAN play a key role in the reconstruction of natural images. The similarity between the presented and reconstructed images obtained by the SC-GAN is significantly higher than that obtained by a condition generative adversarial network (C-GAN).

That is, early visual cortex receives non-visual and potentially predictive information from audition. However, it is unclear whether the transfer of auditory information to early visual areas is an epiphenomenon of visual imagery or, alternatively, whether it is driven by mechanisms independent from visual experience. Here, we show that we can decode natural sounds from activity patterns in early “visual” areas of congenitally blind individuals who lack visual imagery. Thus, visual imagery is not a prerequisite of auditory feedback to early visual cortex. Furthermore, the spatial pattern of sound decoding accuracy in early visual cortex was remarkably similar in blind and sighted individuals, with an increasing decoding accuracy gradient from foveal to peripheral regions. This suggests that the typical organization by eccentricity of early visual cortex develops for auditory feedback, even in the lifelong absence of vision. The same feedback to early visual cortex might support visual perception in the sighted [1] and drive the recruitment of this area for non-visual functions in blind individuals [2, 3].; Natural sounds can be distinguished based on early visual cortex activity in sighted people. Is this effect driven by visual imagery?

Separable modes of neural activity encoded history-guided motor plans, with similar population dynamics in individual areas throughout cortex.

Greater daily life prosthesis usage correlated positively with greater prosthesis categorisation. Moreover, when comparing prosthesis users' representation of their own prosthesis to controls' representation of a similar looking prosthesis, prosthesis users represented their own prosthesis more dissimilarly to hands, challenging current views of visual prosthesis embodiment. Our results reveal a use-dependent neural correlate for wearable technology adoption, demonstrating adaptive use-related plasticity within the OTC. Because these neural correlates were independent of the prostheses' appearance and control, our findings offer new opportunities for prosthesis design by lifting restrictions imposed by the embodiment theory for artificial limbs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {Brain Decoding is a popular topic in neuroscience. The purpose is how to reconstruct an object that came from a sensory system using brain activity data. There is three brain area generally use in brain decoding research. The somatosensory area generally using mice and touch they whisker. Auditory area using different sound frequency as stimuli. The visual area using shape, random image, and video. Take one example in the visual cortex. Using the retinotopic mapping concept, the object possible to reconstruct using visual cortex activity recorded by fMRI. Retinotopic mapping focus is to relate fMRI records into visual objects seen by the subject. This brain possibilities of decoding research come to the next level when combining using deep learning. The image seen by the subject can be reconstructed by using visual cortex activity. Make reconstruction come faster and realistic to predict the stimuli. This opportunity is opening the era of the brain-computer interface. Combine a method to analyze brain functionality related to the human sensory. Bring hope and increased human quality of life. This paper reviews research in the field of brain encoding. Divide into three sections, the first section is brain decoding research in somatosensory. The second section is brain decoding in the auditory cortex. For the last section, explain visual cortex reconstruction. Every section includes equipment devices to record brain activity and the source of datasets and methods to get the brain activity data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract  = {Neural coding is one of the central questions in systems neuroscience for understanding how the brain processes stimulus from the environment, moreover, it is also a cornerstone for designing algorithms of brain–machine interface, where decoding incoming stimulus is highly demanded for better performance of physical devices. Traditionally researchers have focused on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data as the neural signals of interest for decoding visual scenes. However, our visual perception operates in a fast time scale of millisecond in terms of an event termed neural spike. There are few studies of decoding by using spikes. Here we fulfill this aim by developing a novel decoding framework based on deep neural networks, named spike-image decoder (SID), for reconstructing natural visual scenes, including static images and dynamic videos, from experimentally recorded spikes of a population of retinal ganglion cells. The SID is an end-to-end decoder with one end as neural spikes and the other end as images, which can be trained directly such that visual scenes are reconstructed from spikes in a highly accurate fashion. Our SID also outperforms on the reconstruction of visual stimulus compared to existing fMRI decoding models. In addition, with the aid of a spike encoder, we show that SID can be generalized to arbitrary visual scenes by using the image datasets of MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Furthermore, with a pre-trained SID, one can decode any dynamic videos to achieve real-time encoding and decoding of visual scenes by spikes. Altogether, our results shed new light on neuromorphic computing for artificial visual systems, such as event-based visual cameras and visual neuroprostheses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},	keywords  = {Aldehydes; Decoding; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image reconstruction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Signal encoding; Video signal processing; Vision; Artificial retinas; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Natural scenes; Neural decoding; Neural spike; Neuromorphic computing; Real-time encoding; Retinal ganglion cells; Functional neuroimaging; Article; deep learning; deep neural network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; longitudinal study; mathematical computing; priority journal; retina; retina ganglion cell; spike image decoder; vision; visual system; animal; biological model; brain computer interface; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; visual cortex; visual evoked potential; Animals; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological; Neural Networks, Computer; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Visual Cortex; Visual Perception},
